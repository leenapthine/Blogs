# Development Blog Archive

This repository preserves a collection of debveloper blog posts I wrote during my time at [ARCsoft](https://arcsoft.uvic.ca/).

These posts cover topics I explored and contributed to as part of our development work on OpenStack automation tools, infrastructure planning, and testing strategies. They are reproduced here in their original wording for portfolio and archival purposes.

Each post is stored as a Markdown file in the root of this repository. Original publish dates and links are included at the top of each file.
